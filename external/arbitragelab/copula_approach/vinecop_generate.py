        Auto fit data to the C-vine copula by selecting the center stock.

        The method will loop through all possible C-vine structures and choose the best fit by AIC. The targeted
        stock will never show up in the center of the tree, thus some C-vine structures need not be included. This
        method is relatively slow, and the complexity is O(n!) with n being the number of stocks and there is no way
        to work around this. Hence please keep n <= 7.

        The original method suggested in [Stubinger et al. 2016] says the target stock should not be at the center of
        each level of the C-vine tree, due to the way conditional probabilities are calculated. However the C-vine
        structure effectively orders the variables by their importance of dependency, the target stock makes sense to
        be the most important node. I.e, for the C-vine structure (4, 2, 1, 3), variable 3 should be the target stock,
        in contrast to variable 4 as suggested in [Stubinger et al. 2016]. Therefore we provide both options by toggling
