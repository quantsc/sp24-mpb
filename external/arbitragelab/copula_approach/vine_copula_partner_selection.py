    Implementation of the Partner Selection procedures proposed in Section 3.1.1 in the following paper.

    3 partner stocks are selected for a target stock based on four different approaches namely, Traditional approach,
    Extended approach, Geometric approach and Extremal approach.

    In this module, target stock implies the ticker for which a unique combination of stocks is returned.
    The stocks present in this unique combination are called partner stocks.
